Generate a professional and effective formal complaint email based on the following user input:\n\n**USER'S ORIGINAL PROMPT**:{user_input}\n\nEnhance and expand upon the user's request to create a compelling complaint email that adheres to these guidelines:\n\n1. **Subject**: At first write a short appropriate subject. Write the subject in bold and write like '**Subject**: [email subject]'. Make sure to give two line gap below it.\n   Points while writing the subject:\n      - **Be Specific**: Clearly mention the nature of the complaint in the subject line. For example, 'Complaint Regarding Product Quality or 'Issue with Customer Service Experience'.\n\n      - **Use Keywords**: Include keywords related to the complaint to grab the recipient's attention. This helps in immediately indicating the content of the email. For instance, 'Urgent: Billing Discrepancy Complaint'.\n\n      - **Indicate Urgency (If Applicable)**: If the complaint requires immediate attention or is time-sensitive, consider including words like 'Urgent' or 'Immediate Action Required' in the subject line.\n\n      - **Keep it Concise**: Ensure the subject line is brief and to the point. Aim to convey the essence of the complaint succinctly.\n\n2. **Salutation**: Start with appropriate salutation respect to the position of the recipient. For general use 'Dear'.\n\n3. **Introduction**: After salutation introduce the sender, not personally but with the respect to relation with the company. Then Outline the fundamental information in very short, for example 'I am a long-time user of Office Suite Pro and I am writing  to complain about a recent issue where the license key provided for my latest purchase is showing as invalid' or if it's my first product or service of this company then 'I am writing to make a formal complaint about', something like this. \n\n   Overall, get to the point as quickly as possible. In the first paragraph of your email, you should concisely share the basic details of your issue.\n\n   The first part of your complaint email should include the following:\n      - The issue\n      - How you discovered the issue\n      - Any logistical details you can include (date, time, location)\n\n4. **Summarize Your Experience**: Now Change the paragraph and write the main body of the email. Using plain language, describe how this issue impacted your experience. Don’t beat around the bush; most people don’t have time to read a long, emotional letter. Stick to facts.\n\n   This part of your complaint email might include these:\n   - How the issue affected you or your business\n   - What you’ve done to try to resolve the issue on your own.\n\n5. **Describe Your Desired Results in Very Short**: Unless your only goal is to get the incident off your chest, include a way to fix the issue so the recipient understands what actions can be taken to reach a resolution. Consider what you want to come of your complaint: Are you looking for a replacement, a conversation, a policy change, or compensation? Be direct about how you’d like to resolve the matter.\n\n   Try to include these details to get the best response.\n      - A clear and specific outcome that would satisfy you\n      - Constructive comments\n      - A time frame in which to resolve the issue\n\n6. After Conclusion add a sentence like 'Thank you for your time and assistance' for better impression.\n\n6.  **Include Attachments**: Support your claims with evidence wherever possible. You can simply explain your evidence in writing or, more compellingly, attach supporting files to the email.\n\n7. **Sign off Professionally**: Complaint emails should be professional. Writing “Sincerely” and then your name is usually sufficient. Include a professional email signature if you’re writing your email in your workplace or on behalf of a business.\n\n\n## Points to Note\n\n   1. Without starting with any casual talk, directly start writing the email\n\n   2. Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the issue, including:\n      a. Relevant dates, times, and locations\n      b. Specific details of the problem or unsatisfactory experience\n      c. Any previous attempts to resolve the issue\n\n   3. Structure the email with logical paragraph breaks. Keep it within 3-4 paragraph, \n      - Introduction\n      - Main body\n      - Conclusion/Call for action\n\n   4. Include any relevant policy numbers, transaction details, or reference numbers.\n\n   5. Propose a specific timeline for addressing the complaint.\n\n   6. Close with or write the conclusion with a call-to-action, requesting a response or specific next steps.\n\n   7. Ensure impeccable grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout.\n\n   8. If applicable, mention any consumer rights or relevant regulations without being confrontational.\n\n   9. Maintain a solution-oriented approach, expressing willingness to work towards a mutually satisfactory resolution.\n\n   10. if applicable, end the email with a specific time-frame within which you expect a response, typically 7 to 14 days, to convey your expectations for a prompt resolution.\n\n   11. Keep your email focused on factual information and avoid using emotional language or making threats.\n\n   12. Introduction will be in only within 2-3 lines, main-body will be in detailed and again conclusion will be in short (typically 3-4 lines)\n\n   12. Keep the email brief.\n\n## Example\n\n`\nDear Mr. Tremaine,\n\nI’m writing to complain about how my manager, Jared Molton, behaved during our annual review meeting. He made belittling jokes and attempted to intimidate me.\n\nI’ve spoken with Jared on multiple occasions (1/12/22, 3/15/22, and 6/27/22, among others) about his behavior, but these conversations have not changed his behavior. These encounters are documented through Slack messages, emails, and recorded Zoom calls. You can find these attached to this email. His actions have made me feel deeply uncomfortable and isolated at work. I am concerned that his evaluations of me, my performance, and my place on this team are biased and unfair. Amber Dreyfus, Claire Powell, and Eric Bingham were also present during many of these interactions.\n\nI’d like to speak with you and a representative from HR to discuss how we may resolve this conflict. At the very least, I’d like to be transferred to another department under a different manager so I can continue to work. I’d appreciate it if you’d get back to me soon with the next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance in resolving this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJada Rowen\n`\n\nGenerate a polished, professional complaint email that effectively communicates the issue, maintains a respectful tone, and clearly outlines the desired outcome."
